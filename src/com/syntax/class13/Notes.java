		 * Classes and object Classes are blueprints, idea, designs or templates from
		 * which we create the Programming object. Programming objects: Programming
		 * objects are similar to real life object. They have attributes and
		 * Behaviors,Attributes represent the sate of objects and behaviors repent the
		 * integration of those object.

		 * Class student{ 
		 * String name; 
		 * String id; 
		 * int age; 
		 * char gender; 
		 * double gpa;
		 * void(){ Systeam.out.println(name+" is studying");
		 *  } public static void main(String[] args) { 
		 * Student Kishan=new Student

		 * class MethodsDemo{ void method(){

		 * } }
		 * 
		 * Methods:
		 * A block of code or set of instructions that are executed when we call a method.
		 * 
		 * Two main types of methods 
		 * Predefined (built-in) and user defined
		 * predefined methods are the methods created by java guys they are part of JDK
		 * like nextInt method 
		 * User defined methods are the method that are created by us.
		 * 
		 * void addTwoNumber(int num1, int num2){
		 * Syso(num1+num2);
		 * }
		 * 
		 * Steps to define a method:
		 * 1) return Types:
		 *    for example in above case void is a return types that means this method does not 
		 *    return any data it can just execute some logic or can print something on the console.
		 *    other example of written types are int String etc basically we can return all data types 
		 *    from a method even the objects and arrays.
		 * 2) Method name:
		 *    addTwoNumbers is the method name in above example   
		 * 3) Method Header:
		 *    int addTwoNumbers(int num1, num2) is call method header
		 * 4) addTwoNumber(int num1,int num2) is called method signature
		 * 5) (int num1, int num2) is called a parameter list the input to the method   
		 *    all the data types we can return from a method we can also take that as input
		 *    in the form parameters 
		 * 6) {
		 *    Syso(num1+num2);
		 *    }
		 *    is called the method body that contains the logic that is executed when we call a method
		 *
		 * 7) syntax to call a method 
		 *    method object=new Method();
		 *    object:addTwoNumber(10,20);
		 * 8) return is the keyword that we use to return the data from a method in 
		 *    above example we are not returning anything
